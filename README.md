### Hi 👋, I'm Nate
A former fish wrangler who leverages my passion for maps to enhance public access to the outdoors.

I’m currently working on improving boating access in Oklahoma through the [OK Dept. of Wildlife Conservation][odwc] and created [FloodNotice][floodnotice_ios] to provide a convenient method for viewing stream flow observations and forecasts from the National Weather Service. Check out my [portfolio][portfolio_link] to see the other projects of interest.

### Ask me about:

- 🗄 ArcGIS REST API queries with GDAL, Python, & R
- 📡 Cloud workflows and storage using AWS ECS, S3, & SharePoint
- 🛥 Boating Access Grants through the [U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Boating Access Sub-program][fws_boating-access]
